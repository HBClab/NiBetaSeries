Code of Conduct
===============

We value the participation of every member of our community and want to
ensure an that every contributor has an enjoyable and fulfilling
experience. Accordingly, everyone who participates in the NiBetaSeries
project is expected to show respect and courtesy to other community
members at all time.

The lead maintainer of the NiBetaSeries `James
Kent <https://github.com/https://github.com/jdkent>`__ is dedicated to a
**harassment-free experience for everyone**, regardless of gender,
gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical
appearance, body size, race, age or religion. **We do not tolerate
harassment by and/or of members of our community in any form**.

*We are particularly motivated to support new and/or anxious
collaborators, people who are looking to learn and develop their skills,
and anyone who has experienced discrimination in the past.*

Our expectations
----------------

To make clear what is expected, we ask all members of the community to
conform to the following Code of Conduct.

-  All communication - online and in person - should be appropriate for
   a professional audience including people of many different
   backgrounds. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate at any
   time.

-  Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other contributors.

-  Behave professionally. Remember that harassment and sexist, racist,
   or exclusionary jokes are not appropriate.

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment
include:

-  Using welcoming and inclusive language
-  Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
-  Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
-  Focusing on what is best for the community
-  Showing empathy towards other community members

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual
orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion,
sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking,
following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of
discussions, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual
attention.

Examples of unacceptable behavior by community members include:

-  The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual
   attention or advances
-  Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political
   attacks
-  Public or private harassment
-  Publishing others’ private information, such as a physical or
   electronic address, without explicit permission
-  Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
   professional setting

**Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to
comply immediately.**

Our Responsibilities
--------------------

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of
acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair
corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit,
or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other
contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban
temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they
deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Enforcement
-----------

Members of the community who violate these rules - no matter how much
they have contributed to the NiBetaSeries, or how specialised their
skill set - will be approached by Peer or Rita. If inappropriate
behaviour persists after this discussion, the contributor will be asked
to discontinue their participation in the project.

**To report an issue you have with community interactions** please
contact `James <https://github.com/jdkent>`__. All communication will be
treated as confidential.
