# Introduction

You may not be aware of it, but your brain is orchestrating a complex ballet of activity while reading this sentence.
Whether it is following a dot, reading a sentence, interpreting what response is required when presented with a red square; the brain is evaluating input and sending motoric output to perform optimally/efficiently.
We can measure and analyze this flurry of activity using functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI).
Traditional fMRI analysis emphasizes what regions are "activated/deactivated" during a task, but does not provide information on which regions are acting in synchrony.
Knowing what regions are synchronous during a task gives insights on the potential organization of the brain.
NiBetaSeries seeks to fill this gap by providing a method to measure how activation patterns between brain regions are correlated across trials.
That is to say if region A and region B both show high activity on trial 1, low activity on trial 2, medium activity on trial 3, and so on, then these two regions are highly correlated.

# Background

To understand NiBetaSeries we need to answer two questions: what is a "beta" and what is an "atlas parcellation"?
We have already mentioned betas by another name, activation/deactivation.
The term beta comes from its use in the Generalized Linear Model (GLM), a family of statistical models that is used to fit non-normal/non-gaussian data.
fMRI signal evoked by a stimulus follows a relatively stereotyped shape from the Blood Oxygen Level Dependent (BOLD) response, which is best modelled with a double-gamma function (e.g. not a gaussian/normal function).
The peak of the gamma curve (i.e. activation/deactivation) is determined by the beta coefficient.
Thus larger betas mean greater activation, and smaller or negative betas mean less activation or deactivation.
Traditional fMRI analysis will group together all the relevant trial types and give them all one beta estimate, where variance between trials is treated as noise.
NiBetaSeries, on the other hand, gives each trial its own beta estimate treating the variance between trials as the signal of interest.
The final complication to understand betas is the multiple methods we can use to derive individual beta estimates.
Two common methods are least squares all (LSA) and least squares separate (LSS).
LSA places all the trials in the same GLM, where each trial is a separate predictor.
LSA works well when the trials are far apart in time since the BOLD response takes a long time to return to baseline.
When the trials are close together, however, the bold responses start to overlap and the GLM cannot accurately attribute the variance in the fMRI data to trial 1 or trial 2, leading to unreliable beta estimates.
LSS tackles this problem by making as many GLMs as there are trials.
For each trial, a GLM is created where one predictor is the trial of interest and the other predictor is the combination of the other trials.
This reduces the amount of overlap (or more accurately correlation) between predictors, leading to more reliable individual beta estimates.
NiBetaSeries currently implements LSS making it an ideal candidate for experiments with trials that occur closer together (e.g. 3-7 seconds apart on average).

The second question of what an atlas parcellation is will hopefully be easier to explain.
The brain can be cut up in many ways, either via anatomical landmarks, by which regions are activated by a task of theoretical interest, by how the brain organizes itself when not engaged in any external task, or any number of other creative methods.
Once we have selected our parcellation method, we need to label which voxels belongs to which parcel.
A voxel is shortened from the term volumetric pixel, unlike typical pictures our brain images are 3 dimensional, so in order to account for the volume we use 3D voxels instead of 2D pixels.
A parcel is a collection of voxels that are designated to be a part of the same group.
Group membership is decided based on the parcellation method.
We label group membership by giving each voxel within a parcel the same integer (e.g. the voxels within the left insula may all be labelled with the integer 12).
The collection of parcels (i.e. a parcellation) identifies all the unique brain areas of interest and that image is used in NiBetaSeries.

Putting betas and atlas parcellations together, we have a recipe to create betaseries correlations in NiBetaSeries.
Applying the GLM to the fMRI data outputs voxelwise beta estimates for each trial.
Then each parcel's voxels (containing the beta estimates) are averaged together in each trial.
The averaging of beta estimates within each parcel is repeated over all the trials resulting in a list of averaged beta estimates for every parcel.
Each entry in the list represents a trial.
The list of betas for each parcel can then be correlated with every other parcel to measure the degree of synchrony between them.
The correlation matrix can then be used for downstream analysis.

# Overview

NiBetaSeries presents as a command line utility written in python.
The primary way for users to interact with NiBetaSeries is by typing `nibs` in the command line.
The basic workflow of NiBetaSeries follows these steps (the files can be found in the `workflows` directory):
1) `base.py`: read and validate necessary inputs (a minimally processed fMRI file, a brain mask, an events file specifying the onsets, duration, and the trial type, an atlas parcellation, and a table connecting the numbers in the atlas parcellation with names of the regions).
2) `model.py`: construct and execute GLMs using LSS (with additional confound predictors optionally added) generating a betaseries (a list of betas for each voxel).
3) `analysis.py`: apply atlas parcellation to data averaging betas within regions for each trial.
4) `analysis.py`: correlate each region's list of betas with every other region.
5) `analysis.py`: r-z transform the correlations and output a symmetric correlation matrix in a `tsv` file.

The correlation matrix from NiBetaSeries can be used for graph theoretical analysis, specific region-region correlations across different trial types, and other analytic strategies.

NiBetaSeries is not the first or only piece of software that measures task related correlations in the brain.
There are two other packages known to the author: BASCO and pybetaseries [@Gottlich2015; @Poldrack2014].
BASCO (BetA Series COrrelations) is a matlab toolbox that calculates task correlations, but is designed for slow event related designs (e.g. trials occur more than 10 seconds apart).
pybetaseries is a python script that is designed for fast event related designs (like NiBetaSeries), but is no longer actively maintained.
Given the drawbacks of the alternatives, NiBetaSeries justifies its existence and utility to the neuroscience field.
