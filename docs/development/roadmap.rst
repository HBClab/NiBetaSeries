Roadmap
=======

This page serves as a reference to the overall goals of NiBetaSeries development.

Goals
-----

1. Flexibly generate beta series maps for the user.
2. Provide analyses of beta series maps for the user.
3. Keep code test coverage at least at 70% because this allows for decent expections
   towards what the software claims to do, while maintaining enough wiggle room for code
   that cannot reasonably be tested at that time.
   Please read `testivus <https://www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.jsp?thread=204677>`_
   for more information and an entertaining story.
4. Support the `BIDS <https://bids.neuroimaging.io/>`_ community through
   adding to the specification and maintaining conformance with the specification.
5. Welcome/Entice new contributors with non-critical issues.
