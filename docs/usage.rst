In this example we have our top-level BIDS directory ``/home/james/bids``,
and our derivatives directory ``/home/james/bids/derivatives``.
``nibs`` currently assumes that ``derivatives`` is immediately underneath
the top-level BIDS directory.

- The 1st positional argument is the BIDS directory (``/home/james/bids``)
- The 2nd positional argument is the derivatives pipeline that was used
  to preprocess your data.
  In this case we are using ``fmriprep``.
- The 3rd positional argument determines where the desired output of ``nibs``
  should go. These are the output files you will use later on for analysis.
  Here, the directory is:
  ``/home/james/bids/derivatives/betaSeries/schaefer_parcel-400_network-17``
- The 4th positional argument specifies whether we are running participant-
  or group-level analyses; since group-level analyses are not yet implemented,
  ``participant`` is the only option.
- Within the derivatives directory, we have the atlas (``-a``) and
  lookup table (``-l``) in an atlas directory.
  The atlas is in MNI space and the look up table has a row per unique parcel
  in the atlas.
- The work directory (``-w``) specifies where all the intermediate outputs
  go; these are useful for making sure ``nibs`` ran correctly,
  but are not necessary to keep after you are reasonably confident
  ``nibs`` worked as expected.
- The confounds (``-c``) we select are column names from the ``*_confounds.tsv`` file.
  See the `fmriprep documentation
  <https://fmriprep.readthedocs.io/en/stable/outputs.html#confounds>`_ on confounds for details.
- ``--nthreads`` tells us across how many thread to parallelize ``nibs``; in this
  example we use 32 threads!
- If there were multiple types of derivatives output from a preprocessing
  application (like ``fmriprep``), you may only be interested in analyzing
  one variant; in this scenerio, we are only interested in analyzing images denoised
  by ``ICA-AROMA``, denoted by ``--description-label``.
- The HRF model argument (``--hrf-model``) passes all the available options
  from `nistats <https://nistats.github.io/index.html>`_.
