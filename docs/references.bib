abstract = {BASCO (BetA Series COrrelation) is a user-friendly MATLAB toolbox with a graphical user interface (GUI) which allows investigating functional connectivity in event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. Connectivity analyses extend and compliment univariate activation analyses since the actual interaction between brain regions involved in a task can be explored. BASCO supports seed-based functional connectivity as well as brain network analyses. Although there are a multitude of advanced toolboxes for investigating resting-state functional connectivity, BASCO is the first toolbox for evaluating task-related whole-brain functional connectivity employing a large number of network nodes. Thus, BASCO allows investigating task-specific rather than resting-state networks. Here, we summarize the main features of the toolbox and describe the methods and algorithms.},

abstract = {Preprocessing of functional MRI (fMRI) involves numerous steps to clean and standardize data before statistical analysis. Generally, researchers create ad hoc preprocessing workflows for each new dataset, building upon a large inventory of tools available for each step. The complexity of these workflows has snowballed with rapid advances in MR data acquisition and image processing techniques. We introduce fMRIPrep, an analysis-agnostic tool that addresses the challenge of robust and reproducible preprocessing for task-based and resting fMRI data. FMRIPrep automatically adapts a best-in-breed workflow to the idiosyncrasies of virtually any dataset, ensuring high-quality preprocessing with no manual intervention. By introducing visual assessment checkpoints into an iterative integration framework for software-testing, we show that fMRIPrep robustly produces high-quality results on a diverse fMRI data collection comprising participants from 54 different studies in the OpenfMRI repository. We review the distinctive features of fMRIPrep in a qualitative comparison to other preprocessing workflows. We demonstrate that fMRIPrep achieves higher spatial accuracy as it introduces less uncontrolled spatial smoothness than one commonly used preprocessing tool. FMRIPrep has the potential to transform fMRI research by equipping neuroscientists with a high-quality, robust, easy-to-use and transparent preprocessing workflow which can help ensure the validity of inference and the interpretability of their results.},

@article{Rissman2004,
abstract = {The inherently multivariate nature of functional brain imaging data affords the unique opportunity to explore how anatomically disparate brain areas interact during cognitive tasks. We introduce a new method for characterizing inter-regional interactions using event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. This method's principle advantage over existing analytical techniques is its ability to model the functional connectivity between brain regions during distinct stages of a cognitive task. The method is implemented by using separate covariates to model the activity evoked during each stage of each individual trial in the context of the general linear model (GLM). The resulting parameter estimates (beta values) are sorted according to the stage from which they were derived to form a set of stage-specific beta series. Regions whose beta series are correlated during a given stage are inferred to be functionally interacting during that stage. To validate the assumption that correlated fluctuations in trial-to-trial beta values imply functional connectivity, we applied the method to an event-related fMRI data set in which subjects performed two sequence-tapping tasks. In concordance with previous electrophysiological and fMRI coherence studies, we found that the task requiring greater bimanual coordination induced stronger correlations between motor regions of the two hemispheres. The method was then applied to an event-related fMRI data set in which subjects performed a delayed recognition task. Distinct functional connectivity maps were generated during the component stages of this task, illustrating how important and novel observations of neural networks within the isolated stages of a cognitive task can be obtained. ?? 2004 Elsevier Inc.

@article{Mumford2012,
abstract = {Use of multivoxel pattern analysis (MVPA) to predict the cognitive state of a subject during task performance has become a popular focus of fMRI studies. The input to these analyses consists of activation patterns corresponding to different tasks or stimulus types. These activation patterns are fairly straightforward to calculate for blocked trials or slow event-related designs, but for rapid event-related designs the evoked BOLD signal for adjacent trials will overlap in time, complicating the identification of signal unique to specific trials. Rapid event-related designs are often preferred because they allow for more stimuli to be presented and subjects tend to be more focused on the task, and thus it would be beneficial to be able to use these types of designs in MVPA analyses. The present work compares 8 different models for estimating trial-by-trial activation patterns for a range of rapid event-related designs varying by interstimulus interval and signal-to-noise ratio. The most effective approach obtains each trial's estimate through a general linear model including a regressor for that trial as well as another regressor for all other trials. Through the analysis of both simulated and real data we have found that this model shows some improvement over the standard approaches for obtaining activation patterns. The resulting trial-by-trial estimates are more representative of the true activation magnitudes, leading to a boost in classification accuracy in fast event-related designs with higher signal-to-noise. This provides the potential for fMRI studies that allow simultaneous optimization of both univariate and MVPA approaches. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

@article{Abdulrahman2016,
abstract = {Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies typically employ rapid, event-related designs for behavioral reasons and for reasons associated with statistical efficiency. Efficiency is calculated from the precision of the parameters (Betas) estimated from a General Linear Model (GLM) in which trial onsets are convolved with a Hemodynamic Response Function (HRF). However, previous calculations of efficiency have ignored likely variability in the neural response from trial to trial, for example due to attentional fluctuations, or different stimuli across trials. Here we compare three GLMs in their efficiency for estimating average and individual Betas across trials as a function of trial variability, scan noise and Stimulus Onset Asynchrony (SOA): "Least Squares All" (LSA), "Least Squares Separate" (LSS) and "Least Squares Unitary" (LSU). Estimation of responses to individual trials in particular is important for both functional connectivity using "Beta-series correlation" and "multi-voxel pattern analysis" (MVPA). Our simulations show that the ratio of trial-to-trial variability to scan noise impacts both the optimal SOA and optimal GLM, especially for short SOAs. {\textless}. 5. s: LSA is better when this ratio is high, whereas LSS and LSU are better when the ratio is low. For MVPA, the consistency across voxels of trial variability and of scan noise is also critical. These findings not only have important implications for design of experiments using Beta-series regression and MVPA, but also statistical parametric mapping studies that seek only efficient estimation of the mean response across trials.},

@article{Turner2012a,
abstract = {Despite growing interest in multi-voxel pattern analysis (MVPA) methods for fMRI, a major problem remains-that of generating estimates in rapid event-related (ER) designs, where the BOLD responses of temporally adjacent events will overlap. While this problem has been investigated for methods that reduce each event to a single parameter per voxel (Mumford et al., 2012), most of these methods make strong parametric assumptions about the shape of the hemodynamic response, and require exact knowledge of the temporal profile of the underlying neural activity. A second class of methods uses multiple parameters per event (per voxel) to capture temporal information more faithfully. In addition to enabling a more accurate estimate of ER responses, this allows for the extension of the standard classification paradigm into the temporal domain (e.g., Mour{\~{a}}o-Miranda et al., 2007). However, existing methods in this class were developed for use with block and slow ER data, and there has not yet been an exploration of how to adapt such methods to data collected using rapid ER designs. Here, we demonstrate that the use of multiple parameters preserves or improves classification accuracy, while additionally providing information on the evolution of class discrimination. Additionally, we explore an alternative to the method of Mour{\~{a}}o-Miranda et al. tailored to use in rapid ER designs that yields equivalent classification accuracies, but is better at unmixing responses to temporally adjacent events. The current work paves the way for wider adoption of spatiotemporal classification analyses, and greater use of MVPA with rapid ER designs. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc.},
